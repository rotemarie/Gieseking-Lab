# Gieseking-Lab

Goal: generate a body of ab initio quantum mechanical ground state data for silver nanoclusters. 

Previously, undergraduate researchers in the group would manually run the Python script for every nanocluster the lab was interested in.
I created a script that goes through the names of all the relevant nanoclusters and runs the analysis on them to automate the work in the lab and make it more efficient.
